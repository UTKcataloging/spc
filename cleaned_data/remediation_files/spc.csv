After her mother's death in 1884, Dromgoole returned to Tennessee to care for her ageing father and began a career as a writer. She published her first novel, _The Sunny Side of the Cumberlands_, under the name ""Will Allen"" in 1886. She also studied law with her father and won terms as a clerk in the Tennessee State Senate in 1885 and 1887. She was, however, defeated in 1889 and 1891. After her second defeat, she traveled to Texas, where she taught and wrote for several newspapers. She soon returned to Nashville, where she spent her time with her father until his death in 1897. In 1900, she began writing for the _Nashville Banner_. She was hired as a permanent staff member in 1902 and began writing her popular column, titled ""Song and Story,"" in 1903. She continued this column for 31 years. Dromgoole also volunteered for the U.S. Navy during World War I and was recruited as a yeomanry warrant officer (possibly the first woman to serve in this capacity) in May of 1917.

Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in Chained (1934), Spencer Tracy in Edison the Man (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet (1945), and Gregory Peck in The Yearling (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films.

Several wings were added in the 1950s, each named after one of the first co-eds to attend the University. Sophronia Strong's ghost was said to watch over the Hall's residents, appearing as a lady dressed in white on her birthday (February 17) and perpetrating various harmless pranks.

This concept excited Mayor Kyle Testerman, and he appointed banker Jake Butcher to head a committee to investigate the feasibility of such an event. The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.",unknown | Role: Creator | Role URI: http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre,creator

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville.

His dream was realized in 1894 when the Ruskin Cooperative Association (named after English social critic John Ruskin) was established in Tennessee City. The colony soon moved to a site near a large cave on Yellow Creek that still bears the name Ruskin. Wayland led the colony for only a year, and tensions soon developed between those colonists who wanted to apply radical socialist ideals in order to bring about the ""coming nation"" and those who considered Ruskin a haven for such American concepts as political and economic independence. By 1899, this factionalism had caused the colony to disintegrate. The colony was put into receivership, sparking two years of lawsuits between the opposing groups over ownership and control of the Association. Although a few of the colony's members attempted to reestablish it in Georgia as the Ruskin Commonwealth, these efforts proved unsuccessful.",unknown | Role: Creator | Role URI: http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre,creator

Stuart Evans was the original visionary behind the event, which he intended to attract business to central Knoxville and away from suburban shopping malls. This concept excited Mayor Kyle Testerman, and he appointed banker Jake Butcher to head a committee to investigate the feasibility of such an event. The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.",unknown | Role: Creator | Role URI: http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre,creator

When Kyrilla Troekouroff steals his lands, he creates a secret identity, ""The Black Eagle,"" and becomes a masked avenger.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property, including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986. In 2007, Soka sold the property to the National Park Service, which intends to restore and preserve it.","Dapprich, Fred R. | URI: http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2009026625 | Role: Creator | Role URI: http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre",creator

Although the group failed to have the treaty revoked, Menawa was instrumental in having a provision inserted allowing the Creek to obtain legal patents for their land. He, along with Opothle Yoholo, later fought alongside American troops against the Seminole in Alabama.

He is one of Catherine the Great's particular favorites, but he will not be kept as a lover and spurns her advances. When Kyrilla Troekouroff steals his lands, he creates a secret identity, ""The Black Eagle,"" and becomes a masked avenger. Although bent on revenge, he falls in love with Troekouroff's daughter, Mascha (Vilma Banky). Mascha, in turn, worships the Eagle but disdains his unmasked identity, her foppish French tutor Monsieur Le Blanc. Dubrouvsky's love for Masha eventually counteracts his desire for revenge against her father, and the couple flee Troekouroff's estate. Although captured by the Czarina's men, Catherine rescinds her orders to execute the Eagle and the pair escape to Paris.",,
