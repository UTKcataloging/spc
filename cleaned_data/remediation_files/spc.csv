She graduated from the Clarksville Female Academy in 1876 and went on to study at the New England School of Expression in Boston. After her mother's death in 1884, Dromgoole returned to Tennessee to care for her ageing father and began a career as a writer. She published her first novel, _The Sunny Side of the Cumberlands_, under the name ""Will Allen"" in 1886. She also studied law with her father and won terms as a clerk in the Tennessee State Senate in 1885 and 1887. She was, however, defeated in 1889 and 1891. After her second defeat, she traveled to Texas, where she taught and wrote for several newspapers. She soon returned to Nashville, where she spent her time with her father until his death in 1897. In 1900, she began writing for the _Nashville Banner_. She was hired as a permanent staff member in 1902 and began writing her popular column, titled ""Song and Story,"" in 1903. She continued this column for 31 years. Dromgoole also volunteered for the U.S. Navy during World War I and was recruited as a yeomanry warrant officer (possibly the first woman to serve in this capacity) in May of 1917.

He is one of Catherine the Great's particular favorites, but he will not be kept as a lover and spurns her advances. When Kyrilla Troekouroff steals his lands, he creates a secret identity, ""The Black Eagle,"" and becomes a masked avenger. Although bent on revenge, he falls in love with Troekouroff's daughter, Mascha (Vilma Banky). Mascha, in turn, worships the Eagle but disdains his unmasked identity, her foppish French tutor Monsieur Le Blanc. Dubrouvsky's love for Masha eventually counteracts his desire for revenge against her father, and the couple flee Troekouroff's estate. Although captured by the Czarina's men, Catherine rescinds her orders to execute the Eagle and the pair escape to Paris.",,

Thrasher purchased the house in about 1905 and remodeled it completely, adding porches, columns, and the brick exterior. He sold it in the late 1920s to a group of physicians, who renamed it the Howard-Henderson Hospital. It was briefly known as the Acuff Clinic before becoming the Kingston Pike Motel in the late 1950s. When that enterprise failed, the structure was remodeled and reopened as the Kingston Pike Nursing Home. It continued in this capacity until the early 1990s.

Fascinated with movies, he moved to New Jersey where he studied with French director Maurice Tourneur at Peerless Studios. There, the pair directed The Last of the Mohicans (1920). Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in Chained (1934), Spencer Tracy in Edison the Man (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet (1945), and Gregory Peck in The Yearling (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films. When he died in 1987, Brown left $12 million to the University of Tennessee.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986. In 2007, Soka sold the property to the National Park Service, which intends to restore and preserve it.",unknown | Role: Creator | Role URI: http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre,creator

Sally takes matters into her own hands, and aims what she believes to be an unloaded gun at Standish. It discharges, however, hitting Standish and so dissuading him. Thus, both the train and Sally's honor are preserved.",unknown | Role: Creator | Role URI: http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre,creator

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property, including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in ""Chained"" (1934), Spencer Tracy in ""Edison the Man"" (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in ""National Velvet"" (1945), and Gregory Peck in ""The Yearling"" (1947).

When Kyrilla Troekouroff steals his lands, he creates a secret identity, ""The Black Eagle,"" and becomes a masked avenger.

Dubrouvsky's love for Masha eventually counteracts his desire for revenge against her father, and the couple flee Troekouroff's estate. Although captured by the Czarina's men, Catherine rescinds her orders to execute the Eagle and the pair escape to Paris.",,

This concept excited Mayor Kyle Testerman, and he appointed banker Jake Butcher to head a committee to investigate the feasibility of such an event. The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.",unknown | Role: Creator | Role URI: http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre,creator

He is one of Catherine the Great's particular favorites, but he will not be kept as a lover and spurns her advances. When Kyrilla Troekouroff steals his lands, he creates a secret identity, ""The Black Eagle,"" and becomes a masked avenger. Although bent on revenge, he falls in love with Troekouroff's daughter, Mascha (Vilma Banky). Mascha, in turn, worships the Eagle but disdains his unmasked identity, her foppish French tutor Monsieur Le Blanc. Dubrouvsky's love for Masha eventually counteracts his desire for revenge against her father, and the couple flee Troekouroff's estate. Although captured by the Czarina's men, Catherine rescinds her orders to execute the Eagle and the pair escape to Paris.",,

Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in Chained (1934), Spencer Tracy in Edison the Man (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet (1945), and Gregory Peck in The Yearling (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films.

The colony soon moved to a site near a large cave on Yellow Creek that still bears the name Ruskin. Wayland led the colony for only a year, and tensions soon developed between those colonists who wanted to apply radical socialist ideals in order to bring about the ""coming nation"" and those who considered Ruskin a haven for such American concepts as political and economic independence. By 1899, this factionalism had caused the colony to disintegrate. The colony was put into receivership, sparking two years of lawsuits between the opposing groups over ownership and control of the Association. Although a few of the colony's members attempted to reestablish it in Georgia as the Ruskin Commonwealth, these efforts proved unsuccessful.",unknown | Role: Creator | Role URI: http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre,creator

This concept excited Mayor Kyle Testerman, and he appointed banker Jake Butcher to head a committee to investigate the feasibility of such an event. The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.",unknown | Role: Creator | Role URI: http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre,creator

They built their first church on the west side of Prince (now Market) Street in 1820. The congregation grew quickly and moved to a larger building on the corner of Clinch Avenue and Market Street in 1860. The area around the church grew more congested as Knoxville grew, and the congregation sold their Market Street property and moved to a new building on the corner of Clinch and Walnut in 1905. The congregation eventually outgrew this building as well, and moved to a structure on Kingston Pike in 1957.",unknown | Role: Creator | Role URI: http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre,creator

When Kyrilla Troekouroff steals his lands, he creates a secret identity, ""The Black Eagle,"" and becomes a masked avenger.

Dubrouvsky's love for Masha eventually counteracts his desire for revenge against her father, and the couple flee Troekouroff's estate.

He is one of Catherine the Great's particular favorites, but he will not be kept as a lover and spurns her advances. When Kyrilla Troekouroff steals his lands, he creates a secret identity, ""The Black Eagle,"" and becomes a masked avenger. Although bent on revenge, he falls in love with Troekouroff's daughter, Mascha (Vilma Banky). Mascha, in turn, worships the Eagle but disdains his unmasked identity, her foppish French tutor Monsieur Le Blanc. Dubrouvsky's love for Masha eventually counteracts his desire for revenge against her father, and the couple flee Troekouroff's estate. Although captured by the Czarina's men, Catherine rescinds her orders to execute the Eagle and the pair escape to Paris.",,

Gillette died in 1932, and his widow sold the property to prominent film director Clarence Brown in 1935. Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property, including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

Several wings were added in the 1950s, each named after one of the first co-eds to attend the University. Sophronia Strong's ghost was said to watch over the Hall's residents, appearing as a lady dressed in white on her birthday (February 17) and perpetrating various harmless pranks. The last residents of the hall moved out after the 2008 Spring Semester and the building was put to other uses.","White Studio (New York, N.Y.) | URI: http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr99037386 | Role: Creator | Role URI: http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre",creator

He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

He was widely known as a talented and brutal warrior. A determined opponent of both Creek Chief William MacIntosh and MacIntosh's 1825 Treaty of Indian Springs (which ceded all Creek land in Georgia to the Federal Government), Menawa took part in the 1826 delegation to Washington, DC designed to repudiate the treaty. Although the group failed to have the treaty revoked, Menawa was instrumental in having a provision inserted allowing the Creek to obtain legal patents for their land. He, along with Opothle Yoholo, later fought alongside American troops against the Seminole in Alabama. This print was taken from a portrait painted by Charles Bird King in 1826, when Menawa was said to be about sixty years old.
