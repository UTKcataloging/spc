Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in Chained (1934), Spencer Tracy in Edison the Man (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet (1945), and Gregory Peck in The Yearling (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films.

After her mother's death in 1884, Dromgoole returned to Tennessee to care for her ageing father and began a career as a writer. She published her first novel, _The Sunny Side of the Cumberlands_, under the name ""Will Allen"" in 1886. She also studied law with her father and won terms as a clerk in the Tennessee State Senate in 1885 and 1887. She was, however, defeated in 1889 and 1891. After her second defeat, she traveled to Texas, where she taught and wrote for several newspapers. She soon returned to Nashville, where she spent her time with her father until his death in 1897. In 1900, she began writing for the _Nashville Banner_. She was hired as a permanent staff member in 1902 and began writing her popular column, titled ""Song and Story,"" in 1903. She continued this column for 31 years. Dromgoole also volunteered for the U.S. Navy during World War I and was recruited as a yeomanry warrant officer (possibly the first woman to serve in this capacity) in May of 1917. She died on September 1, 1934 and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.",Corbitt

This concept excited Mayor Kyle Testerman, and he appointed banker Jake Butcher to head a committee to investigate the feasibility of such an event. The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.",unknown

Mascha, in turn, worships the Eagle but disdains his unmasked identity, her foppish French tutor Monsieur Le Blanc. Dubrouvsky's love for Masha eventually counteracts his desire for revenge against her father, and the couple flee Troekouroff's estate. Although captured by the Czarina's men, Catherine rescinds her orders to execute the Eagle and the pair escape to Paris.",

Unfortunately, she is already married to wealthy Morgan Leroy (Jack McDonald). Simultaneously, Betty (Barbara Bedford), wife of master diver Caleb West (Broerkin Christians), attracts the attention of Bill Lacey (John Gilbert), who works with her husband. When Lacey is injured, Betty takes care of him and eventually agrees to run away with him. She soon repents of her rash action, but her husband will not take her back. Later, Lacey's ship is wrecked near the new lighthouse and West makes a dive to recover his body. Upon returning to the surface, he discovers that Betty has been operating his air pump, and the two reconcile.",unknown

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville.

Several wings were added in the 1950s, each named after one of the first co-eds to attend the University. Sophronia Strong's ghost was said to watch over the Hall's residents, appearing as a lady dressed in white on her birthday (February 17) and perpetrating various harmless pranks.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.",unknown

Thrasher purchased the house in about 1905 and remodeled it completely, adding porches, columns, and the brick exterior. He sold it in the late 1920s to a group of physicians, who renamed it the Howard-Henderson Hospital. It was briefly known as the Acuff Clinic before becoming the Kingston Pike Motel in the late 1950s. When that enterprise failed, the structure was remodeled and reopened as the Kingston Pike Nursing Home. It continued in this capacity until the early 1990s.

He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986. In 2007, Soka sold the property to the National Park Service, which intends to restore and preserve it.",unknown

He is one of Catherine the Great's particular favorites, but he will not be kept as a lover and spurns her advances. When Kyrilla Troekouroff steals his lands, he creates a secret identity, ""The Black Eagle,"" and becomes a masked avenger. Although bent on revenge, he falls in love with Troekouroff's daughter, Mascha (Vilma Banky). Mascha, in turn, worships the Eagle but disdains his unmasked identity, her foppish French tutor Monsieur Le Blanc. Dubrouvsky's love for Masha eventually counteracts his desire for revenge against her father, and the couple flee Troekouroff's estate. Although captured by the Czarina's men, Catherine rescinds her orders to execute the Eagle and the pair escape to Paris.",

Fascinated with movies, he moved to New Jersey where he studied with French director Maurice Tourneur at Peerless Studios. There, the pair directed ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1920). Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in ""Chained"" (1934), Spencer Tracy in ""Edison the Man"" (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in ""National Velvet"" (1945), and Gregory Peck in ""The Yearling"" (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films.

Linda is suspicious, however, especially since her mother (May Robson) frequently suggests that Van is being unfaithful. These suspicions are apparently confirmed when Van takes Whitey on an important business trip to Cuba. Linda is infuriated, but Whitey manages to convince her that her husband has never betrayed her, thus saving their marriage.",unknown

Fascinated with movies, he moved to New Jersey where he studied with French director Maurice Tourneur at Peerless Studios. There, the pair directed The Last of the Mohicans (1920). Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in Chained (1934), Spencer Tracy in Edison the Man (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet (1945), and Gregory Peck in The Yearling (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films.

Sonny runs to his father for help, but Tolliver is busy preventing a freight train that has broken in half from colliding with the oncoming Limited. Sally takes matters into her own hands, and aims what she believes to be an unloaded gun at Standish. It discharges, however, hitting Standish and so dissuading him.

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

The building housed Air Cadet Training Program students from 1943 until June of 1944, but returned to housing women as soon as the program ended.

Several wings were added in the 1950s, each named after one of the first co-eds to attend the University.

The congregation grew quickly and moved to a larger building on the corner of Clinch Avenue and Market Street in 1860. The area around the church grew more congested as Knoxville grew, and the congregation sold their Market Street property and moved to a new building on the corner of Clinch and Walnut in 1905. The congregation eventually outgrew this building as well, and moved to a structure on Kingston Pike in 1957.",

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.",unknown

Mascha, in turn, worships the Eagle but disdains his unmasked identity, her foppish French tutor Monsieur Le Blanc. Dubrouvsky's love for Masha eventually counteracts his desire for revenge against her father, and the couple flee Troekouroff's estate. Although captured by the Czarina's men, Catherine rescinds her orders to execute the Eagle and the pair escape to Paris.",

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.",unknown

It was originally located at one corner of a rectangular lot with smaller houses in the other three corners, a common frontier design intended to protect against Indians. After the White family established a farm away from this location, the structure was repurposed as the kitchen wing of the Kennedy residence on State Street. In 1906, Isaiah Ford purchased the building and moved it to Woodlawn Pike, where he used it as a private residence. It changed hands again in 1970, when the City Association of Women's Clubs purchased the home and moved it back to central Knoxville. It currently stands near the Knoxville Coliseum and is one of the most visited historical sites in the city.",

His zest for confrontation and staunch Union loyalties convinced the Confederacy to expel him from Tennessee during the Civil War, but he returned to Tennessee in March of 1865 when he was elected governor. During his term, Brownlow convinced the legislature to ratify the 14th Amendment (thus sparing Tennessee from Reconstruction) and made great progress toward restoring the State's economic health. He served one term in the US Senate before dying in 1877.",

This concept excited Mayor Kyle Testerman, and he appointed banker Jake Butcher to head a committee to investigate the feasibility of such an event. The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.",unknown

Brown received a double degree in mechanical and electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee in 1910 and then began a career selling automobiles in Alabama. Fascinated with movies, he moved to New Jersey where he studied with French director Maurice Tourneur at Peerless Studios. There, the pair directed The Last of the Mohicans (1920). Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in Chained (1934), Spencer Tracy in Edison the Man (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet (1945), and Gregory Peck in The Yearling (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films. When he died in 1987, Brown left $12 million to the University of Tennessee. When added to the $1 million donated during his lifetime, the sum made him the largest donor in the university's history.",unknown

The colony soon moved to a site near a large cave on Yellow Creek that still bears the name Ruskin. Wayland led the colony for only a year, and tensions soon developed between those colonists who wanted to apply radical socialist ideals in order to bring about the ""coming nation"" and those who considered Ruskin a haven for such American concepts as political and economic independence. By 1899, this factionalism had caused the colony to disintegrate. The colony was put into receivership, sparking two years of lawsuits between the opposing groups over ownership and control of the Association.

When Kyrilla Troekouroff steals his lands, he creates a secret identity, ""The Black Eagle,"" and becomes a masked avenger. Although bent on revenge, he falls in love with Troekouroff's daughter, Mascha (Vilma Banky). Mascha, in turn, worships the Eagle but disdains his unmasked identity, her foppish French tutor Monsieur Le Blanc. Dubrouvsky's love for Masha eventually counteracts his desire for revenge against her father, and the couple flee Troekouroff's estate. Although captured by the Czarina's men, Catherine rescinds her orders to execute the Eagle and the pair escape to Paris.",

Most of these private owners managed to obtain lifetime leases when the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was created. The majority of these leases were eventually converted to 20-year leases that were later extended to expire in 1992. The Wonderland Hotel ceased operations when its lease expired and collapsed in 2005 while debate over what to do with the historic structures standing in Elkmont raged.

Fascinated with movies, he moved to New Jersey where he studied with French director Maurice Tourneur at Peerless Studios. There, the pair directed ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1920). Brown directed or produced more than fifty widely-acclaimed full length motion pictures and worked with many of the most famous performers in the film industry, including Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in ""Chained"" (1934), Spencer Tracy in ""Edison the Man"" (1940), Elizabeth Taylor in ""National Velvet"" (1945), and Gregory Peck in ""The Yearling"" (1947). At the time of his retirement in 1952, Brown had received six Academy Award nominations for Best Director and won eight Oscars for his films. When he died in 1987, Brown left $12 million to the University of Tennessee.

He is one of Catherine the Great's particular favorites, but he will not be kept as a lover and spurns her advances. When Kyrilla Troekouroff steals his lands, he creates a secret identity, ""The Black Eagle,"" and becomes a masked avenger. Although bent on revenge, he falls in love with Troekouroff's daughter, Mascha (Vilma Banky). Mascha, in turn, worships the Eagle but disdains his unmasked identity, her foppish French tutor Monsieur Le Blanc. Dubrouvsky's love for Masha eventually counteracts his desire for revenge against her father, and the couple flee Troekouroff's estate. Although captured by the Czarina's men, Catherine rescinds her orders to execute the Eagle and the pair escape to Paris.",

Brown regularly hosted large parties for well-known Hollywood personalities here, and made several changes to the property, including the addition of a projection room and a small airport. He sold the property to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church in 1952, which used it as a seminary and noviate. The Claretians subsequently sold to Elizabeth Clair Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant in 1977, which in turn sold to the Soka University of American in 1986.

The Knoxville International Energy Exposition, Incorporated (KIEE) was formed in 1976 and Exposition bankers gradually acquired the 67 acre fair site near downtown Knoxville. The fair itself attracted about 11 million visitors, but did not achieve Evans' larger goal, as the event did not spur any major downtown redevelopment.",unknown

A determined opponent of both Creek Chief William MacIntosh and MacIntosh's 1825 Treaty of Indian Springs (which ceded all Creek land in Georgia to the Federal Government), Menawa took part in the 1826 delegation to Washington, DC designed to repudiate the treaty. Although the group failed to have the treaty revoked, Menawa was instrumental in having a provision inserted allowing the Creek to obtain legal patents for their land. He, along with Opothle Yoholo, later fought alongside American troops against the Seminole in Alabama. This print was taken from a portrait painted by Charles Bird King in 1826, when Menawa was said to be about sixty years old.

The home was then located at the outskirts of town, allowing Thomas to farm and raise livestock. Railroad contractor Henry H. Thrasher purchased the house in about 1905 and remodeled it completely, adding porches, columns, and the brick exterior. He sold it in the late 1920s to a group of physicians, who renamed it the Howard-Henderson Hospital. It was briefly known as the Acuff Clinic before becoming the Kingston Pike Motel in the late 1950s. When that enterprise failed, the structure was remodeled and reopened as the Kingston Pike Nursing Home. It continued in this capacity until the early 1990s. It was home to a number of businesses, including a beauty parlor and a restaurant, before Sam Furrow purchased it in 1999.
