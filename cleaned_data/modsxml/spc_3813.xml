   <abstract>"Chained" is the story of Diane "Dinah" Lovering (Joan Crawford), who is having an affair with boss, Manhattan shipping magnate Richard Field (Otto Kruger). Field asks his wife Louise (Marjorie Gateson) for a divorce, but she refuses to abandon her privileged lifestyle and is not upset by her husband's infidelity. Disappointed, Lovering takes a cruise in order to escape her tumultuous personal life. Here, she meets Mike Bradley (Clark Gable), a wealthy Argentinean horse and cattle rancher. The two fall in love despite Lovering's efforts to remain faithful to Field. Lovering eventually decides to return to New York and tell Field that she intends to marry Bradley, but once there discovers that Field has divorced his wife on the condition that he never see his sons again in order to marry her. Lovering cannot disappoint him, but realizes that she has made a mistake a year later when she unexpectedly meets Bradley in Manhattan. Field meets Bradley as well, and realizes that Lovering would prefer to marry him. Thus, he allows her to leave him for her true love.</abstract>
