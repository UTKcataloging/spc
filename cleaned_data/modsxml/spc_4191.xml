   <abstract>Ayres Hall, named for UT president Brown Ayres, was constructed in 1919 to replace decaying Old College, East College, and West College. Although money was raised to preserve Old College (dear to many alumni) it was discovered that its brick, which had been cheaply made, had decayed to the point that it was unsafe to move and the building was razed. Ayres Hall was dedicated in 1921 and has served as the campus's "landmark building" ever since. Chi Omega donated Ayres' first set of chimes in 1950, which rang every quarter hour until they were stolen by vandals in the early 1970s. The Class of 1991 replaced the chimes as their senior gift, thus reviving the tradition of "telling time by Ayres' chimes."</abstract>
