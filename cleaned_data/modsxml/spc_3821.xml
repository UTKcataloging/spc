   <abstract>"Ah! Wilderness" stars Eric Linden as Richard Miller, a young idealist living in Connecticut in 1906. He has just been selected as the valedictorian of his high school class, and intends to inject modern anti-capitalist ideas into his speech. His father (Lionel Barrymore) discovers his plans, however, and prevents him from carrying them out. The town later celebrates the Fourth of July, where Richard spends time with his girlfriend, Muriel McComber (Cecilia Parker). The couple is forced to separate, however, when Muriel's father objects to Richard's letters to Muriel quoting such poets as Omar Khayy%C3%A1m and Swinburne. Heartbroken, Richard goes to a bar, gets drunk, and meets a young prostitute named Belle (Helen Flint). His alcoholic uncle Sid (Wallace Beery) nurses him back to sobriety, but before he can face his parents, he sneaks out to meet Muriel. On his return home, he and his father (who has previously discovered that Muriel's father has changed his mind about Richard) have a talk about the dangers of alcohol and promiscuous women, and all ends well.</abstract>
