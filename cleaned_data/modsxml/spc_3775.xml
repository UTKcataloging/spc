   <abstract>William Allen Dromgoole (usually called "Will Allen" and known widely as "Miss Will") was born to John Easter and Rebecca Blanche Dromgoole in Murfreesboro, Tennessee in 1860. She graduated from the Clarksville Female Academy in 1876 and went on to study at the New England School of Expression in Boston. After her mother's death in 1884, Dromgoole returned to Tennessee to care for her ageing father and began a career as a writer. She published her first novel, _The Sunny Side of the Cumberlands_, under the name "Will Allen" in 1886. She also studied law with her father and won terms as a clerk in the Tennessee State Senate in 1885 and 1887. She was, however, defeated in 1889 and 1891. After her second defeat, she traveled to Texas, where she taught and wrote for several newspapers. She soon returned to Nashville, where she spent her time with her father until his death in 1897. In 1900, she began writing for the _Nashville Banner_. She was hired as a permanent staff member in 1902 and began writing her popular column, titled "Song and Story," in 1903. She continued this column for 31 years. Dromgoole also volunteered for the U.S. Navy during World War I and was recruited as a yeomanry warrant officer (possibly the first woman to serve in this capacity) in May of 1917. She died on September 1, 1934 and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.</abstract>
